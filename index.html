    <h2>Disciple</h2>
    <p>Album: God Hates Us All</p>
    <p><strong>Songwriters: Jeffery John Hanneman / Kerry King</strong></p>
    <br />
    <pre>
    Drones since the dawn of time
    Compelled to live your sheltered lives
    Not once has anyone ever seen
    Such a rise of pure hypocrisy
    I'll instigate I'll free your mind
    I'll show you what I've known all this time
    God hates us all, God hates us all
    You know it's true God hates this place
    You know it's true he hates this race
    Homicide-suicide
    Hate heals, you should try it sometime
    Strive for peace with acts of war
    The beauty of death we all adore
    I have no faith distracting me
    I know why your prayers will never be answered
    God hates us all, God hates us all
    God hates us all, God hates us all
    Yeah, he fuckin' hates me
    Pessimist, terrorist targeting the next mark
    Global chaos feeding on hysteria
    Cut throat, slit your wrist, shoot you in the back fair game
    Drug abuse, self abuse searching for the next high
    Sounds a lot like hell is spreading all the time
    I'm waiting for the day the whole world fucking dies
    I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
    I'll never be the one to blindly follow
    Man made virus infecting the world
    Self-destruct human time bomb
    What if there is no God would you think the fuckin' same
    Wasting your life in a leap of blind faith
    Wake the fuck up can't ignore what I say
    I got my own philosophy
    I hate everyone equally
    You can't tear that out of me
    No segregation separation
    Just me in my world of enemies
    I never said I wanted to be God's disciple
    I'll never be the one to blindly follow
    I'll never be the one to bear the cross-disciple
    I reject this fuckin' race
    I despise this fuckin' place
    I reject this fuckin' race
    I despise this fuckin' place
    I reject this fuckin' race
    I despise this fuckin' place
    I reject this fuckin' race
    I despise this fuckin' place

    <h2>Chemical Warfare</h2>
    <p>Album: Haunting The Chapel</p>
    <p><strong>Songwriters: Jeffery John Hanneman / Kerry King</strong></p>
    <br />
    <pre>
      Frantic minds are terrified
      Life lies in a grave
      Silent death rides high above
      On the wings of revelation
      Multi death from chemicals
      Arrogance has won
      Annihilation must be swift
      Destroy without destruction
      Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
      Awaiting the mass genocide
      Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
      Bodies lie dormant no life
      Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
      Demons not ready to die
      Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
      Chemical warfare
      Artificial fucking peace
      Line up in a death row
      Generals in their slow defeat
      Diminished from this hell
      Banished from the dying world
      The lords of hell await
      Dogs of war are helpless prey
      To immortality
      Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
      Awaiting the mass genocide
      Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
      Bodies lie dormant no life
      Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
      Demons not ready to die
      Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
      Chemical warfare!!!
      Fuck it up!
      Liquidate
      The torture kills the troops that try to fight
      Terminate
      Human pesticide bring days of doom
      Mist falls
      The deadly gas that brings them to their knees
      Sacrifice
      Steal the soul and send his corpse to hell
      Mummified regions lying in dust
      Fall victim to this game
      Petrified corpses bathing in rust
      Taken without being blamed
      Falsified spirits farther they fall
      Soon they will join us in hell
      See the sky burning the gates are ablaze
      Satan awaits eager to merge
      Gods on the throne must be watching from hell
      Awaiting the mass genocide
      Soldiers defeated by death from a smell
      Bodies lie dormant no life
      Rising new souls on the lands where they fell
      Demons not ready to die
      Nothing to see where the sleeping souls lie
      Chemical warfare
      Warfare!
